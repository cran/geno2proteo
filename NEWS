CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.3 (24/01/2018)
-------------------------
1. As the version 0.0.2 did not solve the issue of creating and writting some 
files in the folders that they should not be created, more modifications were done
in this version, namely putting the DNA sequence file uncompressed from the 
gz file to the temporary folder.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.2 (23/01/2018)
-------------------------
1. Changed the function names of the two functions: genomicLocToProteinSequence 
-> genomicLocsToProteinSequence and genomicLocToWholeDNASequence -> 
genomicLocsToWholeDNASequence, in order to keep them consistent with other
function names.
2. Removed "utils" from the import list in DESCRIPTION file, because it is not
 used by the package.
3. Addressed the issue of creating and writting some files in the folders that
 they should not be created, as raised by the CRAN staff, by using the temporary
 folder obtained by tempdir().
