CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0.2 (23/01/2018)
-------------------------
1. Changed the function names of the two functions: genomicLocToProteinSequence 
-> genomicLocsToProteinSequence and genomicLocToWholeDNASequence -> 
genomicLocsToWholeDNASequence, in order to keep them consistent with other
function names.
2. Removed "utils" from the import list in DESCRIPTION file, because it is not
 used by the package.
3. Addressed the issue of creating and writting some files in the folders that
 they should be created, as raised by the CRAN staff, by using the temporary
 folder obtained by tempdir().
